# Core Studio Collaboration: Creative Technology


## Overview

This class consists of lectures, in-class discussions and project work surrounding Creative Technology as a discipline. The first half of the class sessions will focus on computation in context, including history of digital computing and the stories and personalities that have imbued creativity into technology development in the past 70 years.

In transitioning to project work, emphasis will be placed on data collection and visualization, with special attention paid to personal expression and investigation of data stories. 1-on-1 work sessions with the instructor will provide critique on technique, use of visual language, and provide feedback on appropriate balance of expression and invention.

At the end of the semester, students will exhibit their project and/or assignment work in an exhibition that is planned and organized by the students themselves, with the support of the instructor.

## Learning Objectives

Students will come away with a broad understanding of the history of computing and the human societal and context of its invention and innovation. This technology-agnostic approach sets the stage for project work that centers around analyzing creativity in museum in gallery contexts, and collecting data as an instrument for creative storytelling and expression. Specific techniques discussed will be web scraping with [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/), data transformations with command lines tools such as [Imagemagick](https://www.imagemagick.org/script/index.php), and animation and interaction with [Processing](http://processing.org).
