## Assignment One: Intro Statement

In this assignment, you will produce and perform a presentation describing yourself in the context of creative technology based using the framework below. The presentation is not to exceed fifteen minutes.

Each below number should correspond to a slide in your presentation, and each slide should contain a maximum of FIVE WORDS or less (except the museum list), though you should answer the questions verbally in your presentation. Photographs or images are highly encouraged on as many slides as you can. You will present your intro statement presentation in class on Wednesday, January 25. You will be graded on completeness, adherence to the framework, creativity in form and presentation, but not on content. Be honest, as your instructors will use these presentations to help tailor your semester!

### Identify yourself

1. Name
2. Rank the following in order you would use to describe yourself: Artist, Engineer, Programmer, Designer
3. Two things about you that are unique to the class (unrelated to Design & Technology)

### Backstory

4. What was the first computer you ever used? What do you remember about it?
5. What was the first computer you owned? What did you use it for?
6. What was the first line of code you remember writing? What language? What did it do, and why did you learn it?
7. A list of every Museum you've been to in the past five years. (you can use more than five words here ok)

### Accomplishments

8. What's the most creative or artistic thing you've ever done or worked on?
9. What's the most technical thing you've accomplished or worked on?

### Forward

10. What do you like to code or build? Why?
11. What do you wish you knew how to code or build?
12. Who do you look up to creatively or technically?

###Grading

Completeness: 0-100

## Assignment Two: Innovation Presentation

In this group assignment, you will prepare a 15-20 minute presentation for the class on an innovation in computing that has been instrumental in the computing devices we use to consume and create media. The topics will be pre-selected and delivered to each group by the instructor.

Each assignment should include the following:

- Introduction
	- Tell us what we're going to talk about
- Context
	- What year or years were these innovations released privately or publicly?
	- What did people do before these innovations?
	- Describe qualitatively preceding technologies if applicable
- Cast of character(s)
	- Is there a single person or company credited with the innovation?
	- Anecdotes about the inception of the idea, failed attempts, personal conflict. Craft a narrative
- Change
	- What happened when this thing was released? Was it a big splash immediately? How long to catch on?
	- Were early iterations different from what we have today?
- Conclusion
	- A quick sentence to wrap it up nicely

### Schedule

**Feb 1, 2017:** Form groups of two, receive innovation topic, work in class

**Feb 8, 2017:** Present in class


## Assignment Three: In Person Collection Visualization

In this assignment, students will visit a museum and document their visit in an infographic. Thorough documentation of the visit should be undertaken either through manual note-taking or data collected from devices, software and/or services you already use (ie. screenshots of directions, social media posts). Use this documentation as well as found items and ephemera to create a visual, static, non-interactive representation of both the museum and your visit.

### Submission One: Submit Museum Choice to Visit. 
	- Each member of the class must announce their choice of museum, and have museum approved by instructor.
	- Each member of class will have to pick a different institution.
	- Visit it (after approved by instructor)

### Part Two: Design a static infographic of your visit
	- Do not display the name of the institution on your infographic. 
	- NO INTERACTIVITY or CODE
	- NO MOTION or ANIMATION
	- You can draw your visualization by hand or by computer, but you should not copy/paste any maps from online.
	- no restrictions on size, color
	- Your visualization should communicate:
	  1) The entire institution in some way (ie. the entire building or buildings).
	  2) A list of distinct galleries, collections and/or exhibitions on display at the time of your visit. (list them by name)
	  3) A particular collection or special exhibition (with more detail and description of its scope)
	  4) A particular object, artifact or item in the collection indicated in #3.
	     - Include all "tombstone" or didactic information you can

	  Strive to include in some way both Qualitative and Quantitative Data

### Part Three: Display your infographics in Studio
	- 10-15 minute Class discussion around infographic

### Part Four (Optional, not graded as part of this assignment): Process Documentation & Digital Infographic
	- Date and time of visit ARRIVAL, and DEPARTURE
	- Photos
	  - At least one photo of you pointing to something of interest
	  - A photo of the entrance or whole building (or as much of it as you can fit in a pic)
	  - A representative photo of your selected collection, gallery or exhibition.
	  - A photo or series of photos of the object you selected from that collection. 
	- Receipts or tickets stubs, stickers
	- Any collected ephemera you can (exhibition pamphlets, marketing materials...)
	- Any recorded notes on visit
		- Sketches of infographic ideas
	- In-progress images of your infographic

### Grading

1) Completeness 20%

2) Creativity in Data Collection 20%

3) Graphic Presentation 20%

4) Creativity in Display of Data 20%

5) Depth of Qualitative and/or Quantitative Data 20%

### Schedule

**Feb 1, 2017:** Request Museum in class. Priority by random selection. No tradesies.

**Feb 8, 2017:** Allocated time for question & answer/1-on-1 creative review.

**Feb 15, 2017:** Present work (printed & mounted).

## Mid Term Project

In this self-directed project, students will seek out, capture, and re-contextualize image and artifact data.

**Part One:** Identify a website, online collection or dataset to use.
  - Write a paragraph about why this is the best or most interesting data in your own words. Sell it

**Part Two:** Collect and cache the data in a usable format for later use (the final piece should not hit the internet).
  - List the items you've collected quantitatively: How many images, how many megabytes? How many words? How many years of information?
  - Prove it with screenshots and samples

**Part Three:** Visualize this data in a static print-ready graphic.
  - Write a two-sentence explanation of the graphic and the role data plays in it.


**Part Four:** Create an interactive visualization of your material.
  - Design the piece to use a specific interaction input (though it doesnt need to use it yet...). Describe the intent in words
  - Can be "spacebar technology"... a single button input, or a first-person shooter-style interaction
  - The visualization should add something to the information.

**Part Five:** Write a one-page abstract about your visualizations.
  - Include your motivations and learnings, as well as emergent behavior ot qualities of the information.

### Schedule

 **Feb 1, 2017:** Receive assignment
 
 **Feb 22, 2017:** Show your Part Two, Part Three work: informal presentations
