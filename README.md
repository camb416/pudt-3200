## Assignment One: Intro Statement

In this assignment, you will produce and perform a presentation describing yourself in the context of creative technology based using the framework below. The presentation is not to exceed fifteen minutes.

Each below number should correspond to a slide in your presentation, and each slide should contain a maximum of FIVE WORDS or less (except #7), though you should answer the questions verbally in your presentation. Photographs or images are highly encouraged on as many slides as you can. You will present your intro statement presentation in class on Wednesday, January 25. You will be graded on completeness, adherence to the framework, creativity in form and presentation, but not on content. Be honest, as your instructors will use these presentations to help tailor your semester!
