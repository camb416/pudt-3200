## Assignment One: Intro Statement

In this assignment, you will produce and perform a presentation describing yourself in the context of creative technology based using the framework below. The presentation is not to exceed fifteen minutes.

Each below number should correspond to a slide in your presentation, and each slide should contain a maximum of FIVE WORDS or less (except the museum list), though you should answer the questions verbally in your presentation. Photographs or images are highly encouraged on as many slides as you can. You will present your intro statement presentation in class on Wednesday, January 25. You will be graded on completeness, adherence to the framework, creativity in form and presentation, but not on content. Be honest, as your instructors will use these presentations to help tailor your semester!

1. Name
2. Rank the following in order you would use to describe yourself: Artist, Engineer, Programmer, Designer
3. Two things about you that are unique to the class (unrelated to Design & Technology)

### Backstory

4. What was the first computer you ever used? What do you remember about it?
5. What was the first computer you owned? What did you use it for?
6. What was the first line of code you remember writing? What language? What did it do, and why did you learn it?
7. A list of every Museum you've been to in the past five years. (you can use more than five words here ok)

### Accomplishments

8. What's the most creative or artistic thing you've ever done or worked on?
9. What's the most technical thing you've accomplished or worked on?

### Forward
