## Assignment Four: Scraping the School

In this group assignment, students will use web scraping technologies to grab data from the New School Student Work page and tell stories about one of three types of data in each listing: Students' major, Project titles, student names and project thumbnail images.

Each group will scrape the page to generate their own local data files, and then use creative technology tools and techniques to help express findings about the content listed on the New School website.

Students should present their work in class and use screenshots to describe their process as well as tell their 'data story'.
