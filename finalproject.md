Using either definition of the word, students will research and collect found materials and information on their subject, either first-hand or through electronic means, and design an in-person exhibition experience for visitors to encounter and interact with. Works will also be presented by the student in a presentation describing their creative process.

The final projects will be displayed together, and students should work together to establish and align the parameters of their work. All interactive works must run on the same hardware specs and should not utilize any standard human-computer input devices. All works should have an index-card sized creator statement about the work.

Final projects should be grounded in some data, information or imagery related to the institution. Projects should be created by procedural and/or computational means. Works should not be created in, or with the aid of design software, except in the planning or design phases. All relevant imagery, data or information should be sourced and supplied to the final software projects in human-readable text files, or clearly assigned and documented in code. No HTML, CSS or markup should be used in final.

Images used in the projects can be collected either by procedurally downloading via the web (scraping) or collected first-hand. However, any photographs taken by students must be displayed **#nofilter**, without modification in any design packages. The exception is that images may be modified via the command line.

Projects will fall in one of two categories: *Interactive* or *Procedural*.

## Interactive Projects

These projects will create a visitor-controlled experience of the selected institution. Instructions for use should be written in plain text and printed on a single 3x5" index card.

Students should design their experiences to be used for three minutes or less in-person.

## Procedural Projects

Procedural, non-interactive projects may be presented, including static or motion-based works. These projects must include printed, step-by-step documentation on how a visitor can follow instructions to recreate the work, including how to install any necessary software packages.

Project Phases:

4/5 Pitch (informal 5-10 min)
- Declare Institution of interest ahead of time.
- Present draft of creator statement.
- Explain What you want to make: Medium, Format, Technology
- Explain Why you're making it. This answer should not have "I", "me", "my" or "myself" in it
- Explain Who this is for.

4/12 Concept (present 15-20 min)
- Present revised pitch
- Describe how project will work.
- Show how the project will look (mood imagery)
- Describe process for collecting material to represent.
- Illustrate proof of concept (something in code running live).

4/19 Schematic (present 10-15 min)
- Re-present pitch
- Demonstrate working example of the software.
- Feedback from students and instructor on features and functionality

4/26 Work Session & Feedback

5/3 Deployment
- Bug fixing and planning of exhibition

5/10 Exhibition and Discussion
