## Assignment Two: Innovation Presentation

In this group assignment, you will prepare a 15-20 minute presentation for the class on an innovation in computing that has been instrumental in the computing devices we use to consume and create media. The topics will be pre-selected and delivered to each group by the instructor.

Each assignment should include the following:

- Context

	- What did people do before these innovations?
	- Describe qualitatively preceding technologies if applicable
- Cast of character(s)
	- Is there a single person or company credited with the innovation?
	- Anecdotes about the inception of the idea, failed attempts, personal conflict. Craft a narrative
- Change
	- What happened when this thing was released? Was it a big splash immediately? How long to catch on?
	- Were early iterations different from what we have today?
- Conclusion
	- A quick sentence to wrap it up nicely
