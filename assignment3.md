## Assignment Three: In Person Collection Visualization

In this assignment, students will visit a museum and document their visit in an infographic. Thorough documentation of the visit should be undertaken either through manual note-taking or data collected from devices, software and/or services you already use (ie. screenshots of directions, social media posts). Use this documentation as well as found items and ephemera to create a visual, static, non-interactive representation of both the museum and your visit.

### Submission One: Submit Museum Choice to Visit. 
	- Each member of the class must announce their choice of museum, and have museum approved by instructor.
	- Each member of class will have to pick a different institution.
	- Visit it (after approved by instructor)

### Part Two: Design a static infographic of your visit
	- Do not display the name of the institution on your infographic. 
	- NO INTERACTIVITY or CODE
	- NO MOTION or ANIMATION
	- You can draw your visualization by hand or by computer, but you should not copy/paste any maps from online.
	- no restrictions on size, color
	- Your visualization should communicate:
	  1) The entire institution in some way (ie. the entire building or buildings).
	  2) A list of distinct galleries, collections and/or exhibitions on display at the time of your visit. (list them by name)
	  3) A particular collection or special exhibition (with more detail and description of its scope)
	  4) A particular object, artifact or item in the collection indicated in #3.
	     - Include all "tombstone" or didactic information you can

	  Strive to include in some way both Qualitative and Quantitative Data

### Part Three: Display your infographics in Studio
	- 10-15 minute Class discussion around infographic

### Part Four (Optional, not graded as part of this assignment): Process Documentation & Digital Infographic
	- Date and time of visit ARRIVAL, and DEPARTURE
	- Photos
	  - At least one photo of you pointing to something of interest
	  - A photo of the entrance or whole building (or as much of it as you can fit in a pic)
	  - A representative photo of your selected collection, gallery or exhibition.
	  - A photo or series of photos of the object you selected from that collection. 
	- Receipts or tickets stubs, stickers
	- Any collected ephemera you can (exhibition pamphlets, marketing materials...)
	- Any recorded notes on visit
		- Sketches of infographic ideas
	- In-progress images of your infographic
